# Near Eastern Archaeology
## Archaeological Methods
- Archaeology: study of human history/prehistory through excavation and examination of remains
- Bible: biggest source
- Biblical Archaeology: shed light on biblical world using material remains
- Syro-Palestinian Archaeology: expanded later
### Benefits of Archaeology
- expands on ppl left out of history
- get an understanding of distortions in the history
- glimpse into daily life
- how different cultures interacted
- how cultures interacted w environment
- allows absolute and relative dating
### Methodology
- read stratification by "reading the bulk" and dating relatively
- provides local positioning within a site, provides sense of team leadership over sites
- more organized, allows for documentation on xyz plane
- tel: artificial archaeological mound
- radiocarbon dating: $^{14}$C decays at steady rate in organic materials
### Interpretation
- establish context, identify patterns
- correlate w/ written remains
- apply theoretical models to conceptualize patterns
### Limitations
- preservation bias (available evidence might not accurately reflect past)
- tendency to focus on tells
- absolute dating not always perfect
- ignoring outliers due to overfitting to a pattern
- lack of true objectivity
## Geography of Southern Levant
Why didn't Levant civilizations thrive like mesopotamia and egypt?
- lack of extensive river systems

Key features:
- Coastal plain (ashdod, ashkelon, gaza, caesarea, yafo)
- Jezreal valley (connects haifa/acco to jordan river
- Galilee (kineret, nazareth)
- Central Hill Country (Jerualem, West Bank/J&S)

- Philistines
- Phoenicians

### SECOND HALF OF CLASS
**Clasical/Late Antiquity**
- Helenistic
- Roman/Byzantine
- Early Islamic
## History of Research
### Two major influences for research
#### Religious
- Edward Robinson (American scholar) discovered an arch
- Mesha stele
- alongside this, more scientific approaches developed (meggido)
- William Foxwell Albright (father of biblical archaeology)--use archaeology to deepen understanding of the bible
#### Nationalistic
- zionist identity linked to archaeology
- high tech techniques came out to refine research quetions, have more rigor
