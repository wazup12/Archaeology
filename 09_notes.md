# Qumran (قمران) and the Dead Sea Scrolls

## Discovery

- 2 bedouin shephards found first 7 scrolls and sold for cheap
- 16k fragments from 11 caves derived from 900 scrolls
- excavations led by catholic french team
- ca. 100s CE

## The Dead Sea Scrolls Library

- built in 60s
- allusion to physical scrolls and jars

### The Biblical Scrolls

- 25%
- has commentary

### The Sectarian Scrolls

- early Jewish sect that was unkown previously
- emphasis on body purification, hierarchy

#### yaHad scroll (סרך היחד)

- constitution: this is how you join and stay
- leadership structure
- saw forces of good and evil
- talk about instructor (may have been priest)?
- certain leaders (Levites) under instructor
- everyone else called Israelites

#### proto christian text (war scroll)

- war between sons of light and darkness
- apocalypticism of early christianity

#### single copper scroll

- lists treasures of Jerusalem temple
- not clear whether real or utopian list
- very vague
- theory 1: security through ambiguity, dispersed at time of Romans coming
- theory 2: fantasy -- want to leave the current power and imagine the treasures that god would give them

#### temple scroll

- instructions on how to do sacrifices
- imagines newly rebuilt temple
- theory: instructions for future (again, fantasy)

## The Essenes and the “Yahad”

### The “Yahad” in the Dead Sea Scrolls

- belief in eschatology (apocalypse)
- name means together
- dual messianism (descended from Aaron -- priest and David -- king)
- rejection of Jerusalem temple
- teacher of righteousness role (probably founder of the sect that was expelled from/left Jerusalem temple)
- story of battling wicked priest (man of lies)

### The Essenes in Ancient Literature

- described by josephus
- practiced celibacy, communalism of property, purification rituals, etc
- common view: essenes authors of dead sea scrolls

### A Composite Picture of the Sect

- formed in 2nd c. BCE (rise of Hasmoneans)
- popular amongst lower classes + disaffected priests
- embraced determinism, communal property, angelology, celibacy (although mostly from outer groups), would leave to poop (too impure)
- drew on Jewish tradition (biblical scrolls, sacrifice, purity regulations, apocalypticism)
- has similarities to Jesus movement (purity of poverity)

## Interpretations of the Site Remains

- Jodi Magness: common view, Qumran inhabited by Essenes & used as communal settlement
- Yizhar Hirschfeld: Qumran is a farmstead/manor w/ no connection to nerby caves (maybe sectarians bought a farmhouse & converted to assembly space?)
- others reject Essene hypothesis (written by other Jewish groups like Sadducees)
