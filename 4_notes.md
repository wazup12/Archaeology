- figurines of gods, statuette of bull

## Models for Israelite Ethnogenesis
- outside invasion? little evidence
- peaceful infiltration (pastoral nomad) 
  - relates to Izbet Sartah
  - from Jordan? (bronze age pastoralism)
  - traders with Canaan who decided to settle?
- social revolutions model
  - uprising of lower classes against Canaanite rulers
  - took over lands in hill country
  - not much good evidence, but bridges biblical interpretation
- mixed multitude theory
  - "come from all of the above" and used all the strategies above
## The Role of Philistine-Israelite Relations
- differences in:
  - origins and ethnic makeup
  - diet
  - initiation rites
