# Module 12 - Churches and Synagogues of Late Antique Palestine

- dealing with Byzantine pd. (mainly 4th C., some 5th. and 6th)

- 324 CE: Constantine moves capital to Constantinople (Istanbul) -- recognizes political importance of eastern empire
- 396 CE: Roman empire splits into Byzantine (Eastern) and Western Roman Empires
- 634 CE: Near East falls to Arabians, beginning of Islamic pd.

## Churches and Monasteries

### The Early Church at Megiddo/Legio

- 3rd C. mosaic found near modern prison
- adjacent to Legio (6th legion HQ), next Meggido
- pre-Edict of Milan, yet had communal gathering room for Christians
- inscriptions mention donors who helped build -- one was a centurion (high ranking Roman officer)
- shows common acceptance of christianity especially in Roman military, makes Edict of Milan a savvy political move
- mosaic had fish (ἸΧΘΥΣ || ikhthus) -- acronym for "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Our Savior" and corresponded with fish miracle

### The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem

- Christians claim the church was where Christ was crucified & his tomb
- Started with tomb outside Jerusalem
- Edicule (little house) constructed on top by Christians (4th Century)
- Church built on top of the Edicule (~335 CE)
- Church had a rotunda around the tomb (circular structure)
- Had a basilica (church)
- Western Cardo leads directly into atrium between the basilica and the rotunda
- Used to be a Roman temple -- implies a Bishop tasked with finding Jesus's tomb may have chosen the site to discredit the Roman temple & happened to find a tomb (alongside other tombs)

- grotto underneath octogonal rotunda
- rotunda allowed visitors/pilgrims to walk around and gaze up/down, also provided flow for managing large amounts of visitors
